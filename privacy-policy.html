<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 13, 2026</p>

<p>Bin Buddy (a DBA of Randall Warren, operating in Prosper, Texas) provides a small service to help neighbors by moving trash cans to the curb and back on trash day. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you become a customer and interact with our services, including any text message (SMS) notifications we send.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only the minimal information needed to provide our trash can moving service:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your name</li>
  <li>Your home address (for service scheduling)</li>
  <li>Your mobile phone number (for sending service updates and billing reminders via SMS)</li>
</ul>
<p>We collect this information directly from you during in-person visits or initial setup. We do not collect emails, location data beyond address, payment details via the app/website, or any other personal information.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use your information solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Schedule and perform trash can moving services at your address</li>
  <li>Send low-volume transactional SMS notifications, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>"Your cans have been moved to the curb today."</li>
      <li>"Your monthly bill of $X is due on [date]."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Manage customer records and billing (very low volume: approximately 10 messages per month per customer at most)</li>
</ul>
<p>Message and data rates may apply from your carrier. Message frequency varies based on trash day schedule and billing cycle.</p>

<h2>3. SMS / Text Messaging Practices</h2>
<p>We only send transactional (non-marketing) SMS messages related to our trash can service. You provide verbal consent during our in-person visit to receive these messages at the phone number you provide.</p>
<p><strong>Important – Consent Data Non-Sharing Clause (required for compliance):</strong><br>
Text messaging originator opt-in data and consent will not be shared with any third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes. All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information won’t be shared with any third parties.</p>
<p>To opt out at any time: Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any message we send. You will receive confirmation and no longer get messages (though you can still use our service). For help: Reply <strong>HELP</strong> or contact us directly.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information (including name, address, phone number, or SMS consent data) with any third parties, except:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With trusted service providers (e.g., our SMS messaging platform/provider) strictly to deliver the messages — they are bound by confidentiality and compliance rules</li>
  <li>If required by law or to protect our rights</li>
</ul>
<p>No data is used for marketing or shared for any promotional purpose.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information by contacting us. Opting out of SMS does not affect our ability to provide the trash can service (we can communicate via other means if needed). We retain information only as long as necessary for the service (typically while you are an active customer).</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, though no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
<p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, your data, or our services:<br>
