<h1>Messaging Terms</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 13, 2026</p>

<p>Bin Buddy (a DBA of Randall Warren, operating in Prosper, Texas) provides a local trash can moving service for neighbors. We may send low-volume SMS/text messages to customers for service-related notifications. These Messaging Terms explain our SMS practices and your rights.</p>

<h2>1. Message Types and Examples</h2>
<p>We only send <strong>transactional, non-marketing</strong> SMS messages related to our trash can moving service. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Your trash cans have been moved to the curb for pickup today. Thanks for using Bin Buddy!"</li>
  <li>"Reminder: Your monthly Bin Buddy bill of $X is due on [date]. Please pay via [method]."</li>
  <li>"Your cans have been returned after pickup. Have a great day!"</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not send promotional, advertising, or marketing messages of any kind.</p>

<h2>2. Message Frequency</h2>
<p>Message frequency is very low: approximately 10 messages per month per customer at most, depending on trash collection schedule and billing cycle. Messages are sent only as needed for service updates or reminders.</p>

<h2>3. Opt-In and Consent</h2>
<p>You provide verbal consent to receive these SMS notifications during our in-person visit when you sign up for the service. By giving us your mobile phone number and agreeing verbally, you consent to receive these transactional messages at that number.</p>
<p>We do not send messages without this consent. Consent is not obtained via any written form, website checkbox, or keyword signup.</p>

<h2>4. Opt-Out and Help Instructions</h2>
<p>To stop receiving messages at any time, reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any SMS we send. You will receive a confirmation message, and we will no longer send you texts (though you can continue the trash can service—we can communicate via other methods if needed).</p>
<p>For help or questions about messages, reply <strong>HELP</strong> to any message, or contact us directly (see below).</p>

<h2>5. Carrier Charges and Responsibility</h2>
<p>Message and data rates may apply from your mobile carrier. We do not charge you for sending messages, but standard carrier fees (if any) are your responsibility. Contact your carrier for details on rates and plans.</p>

<h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
<p>For questions about our SMS practices, opt-out issues, or to update your phone number:<br>
Randall Warren<br>
Bin Buddy<br>
Prosper, Texas<br>
Email: [insert your email, e.g., binbuddy@localbindbuddy.com]</p>

<h2>7. Additional Information</h2>
<p>For details on how we handle your personal information (including phone numbers and SMS consent data), please see our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We may update these Messaging Terms occasionally. Continued receipt of messages after changes constitutes acceptance. Check back here for the latest version.</p>
